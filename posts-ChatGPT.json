    "post_content": "📌 2.5 Years Since ChatGPT: A Look at What’s Changed and What’s Next\n\nIt was just over 2.5 years ago — November 30, 2022 — that ChatGPT launched. I remember the day after when Chris Dulny messaged me and said\n“This is powerful. Let’s get to work on what it means us.”\n\nSince then, we’ve seen Generative AI transform how we work, how we lead, how we create — and yes, how we plan Tuesday night tacos.\n\nI took a look back at the past 2.5 years of AI transformation and summarized the key themes, signals, and what they may mean for the future. Here's what’s changed, what it signals — and what’s next (especially for Canada 🇨🇦).\n\nTL;DR\nIf you think AI won’t impact your business or your people — you’re wrong. It already has.\n\nMost of it is happening outside your line of sight — in side tools, in shadow usage, in shifting expectations.\n\n✅ The good news? We’re still early.\n ⚠️ The bad news? Wait much longer, and you’ll be playing catch-up — on productivity, on talent, on trust.\n📌 Now is the time to move — strategically, responsibly, and boldly.\n\n\nhashtag\n#GenAI \nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation \nhashtag\n#FutureOfWork \nhashtag\n#CanadaAI",

    "post_content": "Is ChatGPT making everyone feel really inauthentic??? 😳\n\n🤖 Am I speaking to you... or your AI?\n\n📧 Old emails: “hi mate, quick one…”\n📧 New emails: “Greetings Steven, I trust this email finds you well as we forge ahead…”\n\nSame sender, totally different planet.\n\nWhen I can’t hear your real voice, my brain files the message under ‘Probably Auto‑Generated’.\n\nSo if AI improves your grammar but destroys your authenticity, you’re better off without it.\n\nHumans make mistakes, they’re imperfect, unique and distinct - that’s what makes them human. So if you show up with perfect, AI-made, cookie-cutter communication, you’re removing the meaning from your message.\n\n📈 The rise of the LONG—————DASH\n\nPeople are frequently using words and punctuation today, that I never heard 2 years ago.\n\nIn 2025, the simplest authenticity test for a paragraph is it’s “em dash” (—) count. \n\nI don’t even know where that long dash lives on a keyboard, but it seems to be in every email I receive.\n\nPeople weren’t emailing me casually using words like “forge”, “paradigm”, “robust”, “revolutionary”, to discuss trivial issues. \n\nIt’s funny that we can spot AI in someone else’s words, yet don’t realise everyone else can see it in ours.\n\n🫀 The best communicators will SPEAK WITHOUT AI\n\nIf ChatGpt is churning out the same perfect text on every email, post and caption, than maybe the most resonant, impactful and powerful writers will be those that break the rules, get creative with grammar and embrace their typos. \n\nHuman‑sounding text will carry a premium because scarcity drives value, and raw voices are fast becoming the rarest commodity online.\n\nSave AI for spell‑check...\n\nAnd when the message matters.... the pitch, the apology, the love note....spend the extra energy, and speak for yourself!\n\nCredit: Steven Bartlett",

And where best to start with than cricket! Merging passion with learning, I have released this agent which was intially supposed to be just a mock IPL auction game but has since evolved to become a full fledged game, where you can play the role of a team owner (build your own star-studded team), captain your team for simuated match situations with other GPT owned teams! How cool is that!😎\n\nI have been testing and fine-tuning the agent and have also asked a few of my friends and colleagues to test and share their feedbacks!\n\nWould love for all of you also to give it a try and share your feedbacks to enhance the game!🙌🏼 Find the link below and go fullfill your childhood fantasy!👏🏼💯\n\nLooking forward to building more such agents!\n\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g7GekbqQ\n\n\nhashtag\n#Chatgpt \nhashtag\n#OpenAI \nhashtag\n#Agents \nhashtag\n#IPL \nhashtag\n#AI",
