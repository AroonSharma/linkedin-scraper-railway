The code? Outdated and non-functional.\nI had no idea where to start—but I knew I didn’t want this idea to go to waste.\n\nSo I rolled up my sleeves, forked the repo, and started learning.\nI’m proud to share what I’ve built so far:\n\n🚀 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐝𝐈𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐁𝐨𝐭\n An automation tool that helps you connect with professionals (especially HRs) from your dream companies—with custom messages.\n\n𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬:\n• Prioritizes HR profiles from target companies\n• Sends custom messages based on role\n• Plans smart outreach even around LinkedIn’s connection note limit (approx. 5/month for standard accounts)\n\n✨ I’m also working on a feature that stores pending messages and sends them after your request is accepted.\n\nThis was my first automation project. I made tons of mistakes. But I learned even more.\n\nHuge thanks to Avish Mehta for the foundation, and to Mohit Kumar Singh for helping me figure out the messy parts and pushing me forward 🙌\n\nCurious to see this in action?

It's pathetic. \n\nExternal tools provided me a much better insight. \nEven as a marketer handling multiple client accounts, it was easy to create reports. \n\nLet me know if you have better alternatives that you have tried for analytics.\n\nAlso, feel free to tag product managers at LinkedIn :P",

    "post_content": "🚨 My LinkedIn Account Was Hacked — Please Read! 🚨\n\nRecently, my LinkedIn account was compromised and used to create fake hiring pages for fraudulent recruitment activities. Despite having 2-step verification enabled, the attacker managed to gain access — a clear reminder that even strong security can be bypassed in some cases.\nAs a result, my account was suspended due to a high volume of automation activity, which violated LinkedIn’s guidelines. The recovery process involved complex government ID verification and several frustrating steps.\n\n🔒 Key Takeaways for Everyone:\n- Regularly review your LinkedIn login history and connected apps.\n- Stay away from clicking any links in LinkedIn which looks unsecure [Eg: Apply for this job by the below link]\n- Avoid using the same passwords across platforms.\n- Be cautious with browser extensions or apps linked to your LinkedIn.\n- Consider using an authenticator app instead of SMS for 2FA.\n- Keep a backup of your LinkedIn data — just in case.\n\nI’m back now — but this experience was a real eye-opener.\n\nIf you received any suspicious messages from me recently, I sincerely apologize.

    "post_content": "Missing LinkedIn Services for QA & Test Automation Professionals!\n\nWhile LinkedIn has made it easier for professionals to showcase their offerings through the “Open for Business” feature, there's still a major gap for those of us in the Software Testing, QA, and Automation domain. \n\nDespite the critical role QA plays in product success, many relevant service categories are still missing from LinkedIn’s official service listings. Here are a few that should be added:\n\n1. Manual Testing\n2. Quality Assurance\n3. Test Automation\n4. QA Consulting\n5. Software Testing & QA Mentorship\n6. Functional Testing\n7. Regression Testing (Manual)\n8. Regression Testing (Automated)\n9. UAT Support\n10. Salesforce Testing\n11. Salesforce Test Automation\n12. Testing Framework Design\n\nIf you're a QA professional, consultant, freelancer, or mentor—you probably found yourself trying to fit your services under generic tags like IT Consulting or Software Development.\n\nIt’s time for LinkedIn to recognize the specialized skill sets and value that QA professionals bring to the tech ecosystem.\n\nPlease like, comment, or share if you agree—let’s help bring visibility to these essential services and make space for every quality advocate out there!\n\n\nhashtag\n#SoftwareTesting \nhashtag\n#QA \nhashtag\n#AutomationTesting \nhashtag\n#LinkedInServices \nhashtag\n#OpenForBusiness \nhashtag\n#QualityAssurance \nhashtag\n#ManualTesting \nhashtag\n#Tosca \nhashtag\n#SalesforceQA \nhashtag\n#FreelancerQA \nhashtag\n#TestingMentorship",

That was exactly my idea when I started working on a LinkedIn automation tool. \n\nAnd now here's the kicker – I'm giving this automation away for free to everyone!

You won't need to worry about any server costs, API fees, or any other expenses because I'm covering it all. \n\nSo, why not give it a try and let me know how it works for you? Trust me, it might just be better than buying LinkedIn Premium. \n\nGive it a shot and let's make your LinkedIn presence effortless and engaging!
